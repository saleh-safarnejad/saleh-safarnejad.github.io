I am a Computer Engineering graduate from Sharif University of Technology with a deep passion for Theoretical Computer Science and the Mathematical Foundations of Data Analysis and Management. My research interests spans diverse interdisciplinary areas, including Responsible Data Science, Robustness in AI, Deep Learning for Health, and Tiny ML.

During my B.S., I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Bardia Safaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SVrMscYAAAAJ&hl=en) at the RADIAN Lab, focusing on efficient deep learning-based communication systems. Currently, I am part of the Complex Biological Systems and Bioinformatics lab led by [Dr. Kaveh Kavousi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Wf71NcAAAAJ&hl=en), exploring innovative approaches to biological data analysis

I enjoy engaging in deep conversationsâ€”reach out if you'd like to discuss topics like Bayesian Inference, Statistical Learning, or Generative Models. If philosophy, literature, or ancient history fascinates you, connect with me on Telegram to talk about Plato, Homer, or Mesopotamia.
